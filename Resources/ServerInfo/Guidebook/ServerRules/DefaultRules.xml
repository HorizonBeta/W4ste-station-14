  # Server Rules

  The 3 prime directives of the server:
  - Remember to give everyone the benefit of the doubt.
  - Remember to treat everyone with respect, and consider how what you say and when you say it might effect the perception of what you say.
  - If you don't report issues you have to w4sted before they become a major problem, you are part of the problem.

  1 - Dont Be A Dick. \n
  2 - Do Not grief Arrivals \n
  3 - Do not Attack Evac unless it is your objective as an ANTAG \n
  4 - No Combat at CentComm Station, else risk a ban! \n
  \n
  W4sted Has The Final Say.
